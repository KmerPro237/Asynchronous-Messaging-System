  ## Which mechanisms could be implemented to enable real time bidirectional communication between client and server?
+
    - Several mechanisms can be implemented to enable real-time bidirectional communication between clients and servers. The choice of mechanism often depends on the specific requirements of the application. Here are some commonly used technologies for achieving real-time bidirectional communication:

      #### - Websockets:
        - WebSockets provide a full-duplex communication channel over a single, long-lived TCP connection. This technology allows both the client and the server to send messages to each other at any time.
        - WebSockets are well-suited for real-time applications, such as chat applications, online gaming, and collaborative editing tools.

      #### - Server-Sent Events (SSE):
         - SSE allows the server to push real-time updates to the client over a single, long-lived HTTP connection. While SSE is unidirectional (server to client), it provides a simple way to push data from the server to the client without the need for constant polling.
         - SSE is suitable for scenarios where updates are primarily initiated by the server, such as live feeds and notifications.

      #### - Long Polling:
         - Long polling involves the client making a request to the server, and the server holds the request open until new data is available or a timeout occurs. Once the data is available, the server responds to the client, and the client immediately sends another request.
         - While long polling is not as efficient as WebSockets, it can be a viable solution in scenarios where WebSockets are not supported, or the infrastructure does not allow WebSocket connections.
